## Introduction

AI Computing Architecture and System is a course from Miin Wu School of Computing, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU). Our final goal in the course is to accelerate the speed of AI computing. At the end, we completed a system including a single cycle RISC-V CPU, SRAM, and an AI accelerator based on systolic array. We concatenated these building blocks through AXI4-lite bus. All the results mentioned can be found in the `/riscv_mmioAccelerator/` folder.
